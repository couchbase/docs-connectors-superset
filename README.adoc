== Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
Please test them locally, and then submit a pull request.
A guide to using asciidoc, building Antora locally, and working with our repos can be found at https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/index.html[https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/index.html] (this may still be in the middle of being updated).

At a minimum, to build the docs locally, you will need this repo,
and the https://github.com/couchbase/docs-server[Server Docs repo]
in your Antora playbook.

If you are not sure the best way to update the docs, please raise a 
https://github.com/couchbase/docs-connectors-superset/issues[GitHub issue] with your suggestion, putting in as much information as possible.
